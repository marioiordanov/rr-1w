# ERC20 problem

ERC20 contracts operates in his object only. Every transaction interacting with ERC20 contract modifies its internal structure only. There is no way to tell address that you send to it some ERC20 token. Its not like ether where you can make a function call and pass some ethers value.
To be able to send and notify an address of an ERC20 transfer, you have to use approve-pull pattern. First the owner have to approve the receiver to spend his tokens in the next transaction, which is the function call which the receiver will call
```solidity
transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount)
```

# ERC777, ERC1363 solution

Both add a callback to the receiver contract.

## ERC777
 - callback to sender (ERC777TokensSender)
 - callback to receiver (ERC777TokensReceipient)
 - uses registry contract to check if sender/receiver can be notified on send/receive action

Requires more gas to setup. Possible reentrancy, because callback to sender is initiated before updating the state.
On transfer/transferFrom functions the callbacks are invoked.

## ERC1363
 - callback to receiver (IERC1363Receiver, smart contract only)
 -

To use the callback, a different function have to be used transferAndCall
